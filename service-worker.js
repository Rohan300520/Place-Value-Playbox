// This file is no longer used.
// The PWA plugin is now configured to use the 'generateSW' strategy in vite.config.ts.
// This automatically generates a service worker file during the build process.
// All caching logic (precaching and runtime caching) is now defined declaratively
// in the 'workbox' object within the VitePWA plugin options.
